I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.#

Solution:
function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  let arr1Sum = 0;
  let arr2Sum = 0;
  for (let i=0; i<arr1.length; i++){
    arr1Sum = arr1Sum + arr1[i];
  }
  for (let j=0; j<arr2.length; j++){
    arr2Sum = arr2Sum + arr2[j];
  }
  return arr1Sum + arr2Sum;
}
